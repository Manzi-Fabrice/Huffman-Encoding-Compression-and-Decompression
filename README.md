This project implements Huffman encoding for efficient file compression and decompression. Using a binary tree and priority queue, it generates variable-length codes based on character frequencies, ensuring lossless data compression. The implementation includes methods for frequency analysis, tree construction, code mapping, and file operations, providing a comprehensive solution for saving disk space and transfer time.
